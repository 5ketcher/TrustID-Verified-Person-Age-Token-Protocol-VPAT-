**Status:** Informative / Non‑Normative  
**Scope:** VPAT Minor Standard 1.0 (Experimental Policy Profile)

## 1. Goal

This document explains common abuse scenarios relevant to minors and how the VPAT Minor profile reduces risk through:
- minimal disclosure,
- non‑linkability,
- short lifetimes,
- issuer selection and enforcement.

It does **not** claim to eliminate all abuse.

---

## 2. Assets to protect

1. **Children’s privacy** (no identity, no tracking)
2. **Platform integrity** (resistance to account farms and manipulation)
3. **Guardian privacy** (no linkage guardian ↔ child ↔ platform)
4. **Issuer integrity** (prevent token forgery and replay)
5. **Regulatory compliance** (data minimization, retention limits)

---

## 3. Adversaries

- **Account farms** (cheap creation of many accounts)
- **Coordinated influence operations** (mass narratives using fake personas)
- **Fraudsters** (stolen credentials / compromised devices)
- **Curious platforms** (attempting to correlate children across services)
- **Network attackers** (MITM, replay, token theft)

---

## 4. Threats and mitigations

### T1 — Mass creation of “minor” accounts (account farms)
**Threat:** Create thousands of minor accounts cheaply.  
**Mitigations in VPAT Minor:**
- Guardian authorization via regulated AAA introduces friction/cost.
- Attestations SHOULD be time‑limited (e.g., 6 months).
- Tokens MUST be short‑lived (minutes).
- No recovery reduces long‑term continuity for farms.

**Residual risk:** Abuse can shift to adult credentials or stolen attestations.

---

### T2 — Cross‑platform correlation of a child
**Threat:** Platforms or issuers attempt to link a child across services.  
**Mitigations:**
- `sub` MUST be **pairwise per RP**.
- No global identifier is allowed.
- Prohibited claims block stable identifiers (device IDs, hashes).

**Residual risk:** Side‑channels (IP, browser fingerprint) are out of scope; platforms must address separately.

---

### T3 — Guardian identification or tracking
**Threat:** A platform learns who the guardian is or builds a parent graph.  
**Mitigations:**
- Guardian authenticates only with AAA.
- Issuer and RP must receive **no guardian data**.
- Data retention explicitly forbids guardian records.

**Residual risk:** If AAA itself is compromised or policy‑violating, privacy could be impacted. Governance and oversight are required.

---

### T4 — Token forgery
**Threat:** Attacker fabricates VPAT tokens claiming `13+`.  
**Mitigations:**
- Strong signature verification (per core VPAT).
- Issuer metadata validation.
- Key rotation expectations.
- RP must verify `iss`, signature, expiry, and policy profile.

**Residual risk:** Misconfigured RPs remain a risk; operational guidance is necessary.

---

### T5 — Token replay / theft
**Threat:** A valid token is stolen and reused.  
**Mitigations:**
- Very short `exp` (minutes).
- `jti` uniqueness + optional replay cache at RP.
- TLS everywhere; hardened issuer endpoints.

**Residual risk:** Stolen devices still permit misuse; this is not fully solvable without reducing privacy.

---

### T6 — “Truth scoring” misuse / censorship narrative
**Threat:** Misinterpretation that VPAT Minor labels content as “true/false”.  
**Mitigations:**
- Documentation clarifies **signal weighting**, not truth scoring.
- VPAT Minor defines eligibility claims only (age bracket, assurance).

**Residual risk:** Platforms may implement policies poorly; transparency is recommended.

---

## 5. RP controls: issuer selection and trust policy

A core protection mechanism is **RP-controlled issuer allowlisting**:
- RPs decide which issuers are accepted for the minor profile.
- RPs may require jurisdictional constraints (e.g., EU-regulated issuers).
- RPs may require `assurance_level = high` for certain features.

This avoids a single global authority and keeps policy decisions at the platform level.

---

## 6. Recommended RP policy patterns (examples)

- **Allow** minor accounts only with accepted issuers + high assurance.
- **Restrict** high-risk actions for minors (public posting, DMs, live streaming).
- **Rate-limit** interactions from newly verified minor handles.
- **Disable amplification** for minor-originated content by default (optional).
- **Transparency:** disclose how age eligibility affects features.

---

## 7. Security vs privacy trade-offs (explicit)

VPAT Minor prioritizes privacy and non-linkability over convenience:
- No recovery reduces fraud but increases re-verification.
- No device registry prevents tracking but reduces device-level controls.

This is intentional.

---

## 8. Conclusion

VPAT Minor Standard reduces scalable abuse by:
- raising the cost of mass account creation,
- preventing cross-platform correlation,
- minimizing retention and sensitive data collection.

It is best deployed with clear RP policies and transparent user-facing rules.
